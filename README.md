This is a project assigned by TOP (The Odin Project), where our task is to replicate a webpage design that has been provided to us, as closely as possible. The intended design, as well as the intended colors/fonts used, are included as pictures in this repository. We will be utilising the knowledge we have gained so far with basic HTML, CSS, and Flexbox tools. Unlike previous assignments, where we were given a rough template of the webpage to begin, this time, we're going to be creating everything entirely from scratch.
